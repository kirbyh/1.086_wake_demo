# 1.086 Wake modeling demonstration using FLORIS

[FLORIS](https://www.nrel.gov/wind/floris.html) is a tool developed by NREL to compute wake losses. 
Here, we work through several examples in a Jupyter notebook on how to get started using FLORIS. 
You can find the notebook [here](https://github.com/kirbyh/1.086_wake_demo/blob/main/src/example.ipynb).
